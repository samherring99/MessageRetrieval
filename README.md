### MessageRetrieval ###

This repository contains the novel SQL generation prompt templates and iMessage table schema for pseudo-RAG with iMessage data. The goal of this work is to be able to ask questions to your text messages, using SQL translation to retrieve information from a database with simple natural language requests instead of embedding the entire database in a vector store.

Requirements:
- You will need a llama model from HuggingFace (link TBD)
- ggml
- LangChain (version)
- You will need to copy your chat.db file from `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` to a new location (ideally this repo)

There will be more updates made with this repository, as it is in very early stages. Updates coming soon.
